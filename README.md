# python-api-challenge
Create Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using OpenWeatherMap API

Challenge Details:
--------------------
This challenge has 2 files – WeatherPy and VacationPy
WeatherPy performs the following tasks:
•	Generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude and save it in a csv file.
•	Create plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude. 
•	Compute Linear regression for the relationships for northern and southern hemispheres seperately.
VacationPy performs the following tasks:
•	For each city saved in the csv file created by WeatherPy, find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of its coordinates.
•	Create map visualizations of the cities using the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and show the hotel in hover text.
